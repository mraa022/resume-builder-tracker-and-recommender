## Description
The main purpose of this project is to enable users to create resumes by first creating a list of jobs and projects. Then to create a resume, simply chosing which of those jobs to put on there.
They project also lets users get resume recommendations given job a job description. 

## Tech used
React was used for the frontend, and Node/Express was used for the backend. MongoDB was used for the Database. The recommendation doesn't happen in neither the frontend nor the backend. It happens 
in a completely different server. Restful-APis are used to allow the backend to communicate with this server, and to accomplish this, python, sklearn and FLASK are used.
